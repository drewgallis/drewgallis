## [About Me](https://drew.gallis.xyz)

Hey everyone, I'm Drew. I currently work as a Staff Security Observability and Detection Engineering Lead in the financial sector at one of the leading BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) organizations. Throughout my professional security career, I've worked across Security Operations, Detection Engineering, Security Automation, Cloud Platform Security, Kubernetes/Container Security, Application Security, Enterprise Security, and Vulnerability Analysis. I primarily work with security-based agentic systems and natural language interfaces (MCPs/LLMs), Kubernetes and containerized cloud services (AWS/Azure/GCP), modern web applications, visualization and ingestion tools (Elastic Stack, Grafana, Splunk, Sentinel, Datadog), Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible, ArgoCD), and Python security automation through API integrations.

In my free time, I like to experiment in my home lab with hardware hacking projects, local agentic systems, MCPs, and LLM-based tooling. Outside of security, I enjoy traveling, hiking, fly fishing, skiing, attending security conferences, and mixology. To me, security is more than just a job, it's a lifestyle.

I'm currently working on Kubernetes security deployments, detection engineering, security automation with LLMs/MCPs, and building intelligent security systems.
