## [About Me](https://drew.gallis.xyz)

Hey everyone I'm Drew, I currently work in the financial sector as a Senior Security Operations Engineer at one of the leading financial technology BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) organizations. Throughout my professional security career, I have currently worked in Application Security, Platform Security, Security Operations, Enterprise Security, and Vulnerability Analysis. I primarily work with a mesh of service APIs, hybrid-cloud environments, securing containerized enviroments (docker/kubernetes), security automation workflows, vulnerability analysis, and am a long-time python fanatic. 

In my free time, I like to experiment in my home lab's enterprise network with various hacking hardware (Wireless/RF/LAN), cutting-edge SIEMs, custom monitoring, and security automation solutions. Outside of security, I enjoy home-brewing, fly fishing, backcountry skiing, and hiking.
